    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assistants can call OpenAI’s models with specific instructions to tune their personality and capabilities.\n",
    "2. Assistants can access multiple tools in parallel. These can be both OpenAI-hosted tools — like Code interpreter and Knowledge retrieval — or tools you build / host (via Function calling).\n",
    "3. Assistants can access persistent Threads. Threads simplify AI application development by storing message history and truncating it when the conversation gets too long for the model’s context length. You create a Thread once, and simply append Messages to it as your users reply.\n",
    "4. Assistants can access Files in several formats — either as part of their creation or as part of Threads between Assistants and users. When using tools, Assistants can also create files (e.g., images, spreadsheets, etc) and cite files they reference in the Messages they create.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can explore the capabilities of the Assistants API using the [Assistants playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=assistant) or by building a step-by-step integration outlined in this guide. At a high level, a typical integration of the Assistants API has the following flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an Assistant in the API by defining its custom instructions and picking a model. If helpful, enable tools like Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling.\n",
    "2. Create a Thread when a user starts a conversation.\n",
    "3. Add Messages to the Thread as the user ask questions.\n",
    "4. Run the Assistant on the Thread to trigger responses. This automatically calls the relevant tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assistants API is in **beta**. Calls to the Assistants API require that you pass a beta HTTP header. This is handled automatically if you’re using OpenAI’s official Python or Node.js SDKs.\n",

    "An Assistant represents an entity that can be configured to respond to users’ Messages using several parameters like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Instructions**: Use the instructions parameter to guide the personality of the Assistant and define it’s goals. Instructions are similar to system messages in the Chat Completions API.\n",
    "* **Model**: you can specify any GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models. The Retrieval tool requires at least `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` (newer versions are supported) or `gpt-4-turbo-preview` models.\n",
    "    * Note: Support for fine-tuned models in the Assistants API is coming soon.\n",
    "* **Tools**: Use the tools parameter to give the Assistant access to up to 128 tools. You can give it access to OpenAI-hosted tools like `code_interpreter` and `retrieval`, or call a third-party tools via a `function` calling.\n",
    "* **File_ids**: Use the file_ids parameter to give the tools like code_interpreter and retrieval access to files. Files are uploaded using the [File upload endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/create) and must have the `purpose` set to `assistants` to be used with this API.\n",

We recommend [creating one Thread](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads/createThread) per user as soon as the user initiates the conversation. Pass any user-specific context and files in this thread by [creating Messages](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/messages/createMessage).\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads don’t have a size limit. You can add as many Messages as you want to a Thread. The Assistant will ensure that requests to the model fit within the maximum context window, using relevant optimization techniques such as truncation which we have tested extensively with ChatGPT. When you use the Assistants API, you delegate control over how many input tokens are passed to the model for any given Run, this means you have less control over the cost of running your Assistant in some cases but do not have to deal with the complexity of managing the context window yourself.\n",
